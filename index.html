        <p>
            Tom Brady was a California kid who decided to go to school and play footall in Michigan. He played at
            Michigan from 1996-1999 and there were six QB's ahead of him on the depth chart. In his first season at Michigan,
            he was a backup. 1997 Michigan won the national championship led by QB Brian Griese; which Brady almost beat out but
            the coach went with the upperclassman. Brady finally got his chance in 1998. He started every game his junior year and
            won 10 out of 11 games. His senior year was more difficult. Brady was often overlooked in college, even having to
            split time with freshmen Drew Henson who was highly recruited and a local hero, a "can't miss talent", still Tom Brady
            never gave up or complained. That advesity made him work harder and strive to prove that he was good
            enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            Brady's time to prove himself came against Michigan State, in the sixth game of the season.
            Michigan was losing by 17 points with Henson at QB. Brady came in and nearly won the game, throwing for 241
            yards in the final 18 minutes of the game. The following game, Brady threw for 307 yards, further seperating 
            him from Henson and becoming the starter for the rest of the season. Brady finished the season with 2,217 yards
            with 16 TD's and 6 INT's that year. Michigan finished 10-2 and winning the Orange bowl. Tom Brady in that game
            lead two comebacks. One where they went down 14-0 and another when they were down
            28-14. It took overtime where Brady threw the game winning TD.

    <h2>Draft</h2>
    <br>

    <div>

        <img src=https://www.profootballhof.com/assets/1/19/Brady_Tom_Draft_Card_630.jpg?33433>

        <p>
            Tom Brady was selected in the 6th round, 199th overall, by the New England Patriots in the 2000 NFL Draft.
            Brady was expected to go in the 2nd to 3rd round but due to him splitting time in college, he fell off a lot
            of teams draft boards. Brady watched the draft at home with his parents and they were shocked by this. Six
            other QB's were taken ahead of Tom. This lead to his burning drive, that still drives him today. He was
            set to prove to all the teams that passed up on him, that they made a big mistake. Needless to say, Tom
            Brady
            was right. The six QB's taken ahead of Brady were Chad Pennington, Giovanni Carmazzi, Chris Redman, Tee
            Martin,
            Marc Bulger, and Spergon Wynn.
        </p>

        <p>
            Chad Pennington and Marc Bulger are the only ones to have a decent career but still never reached anywhere
            near
            the success of Tom Brady. (well no QB has had the same success as Tom Brady in any draft.) Chad Pennington
            was selected by the
            New York Jets as the first QB taken in that draft. Pennington played eight years in New York and three in
            Miami with the Dolphins.
            Pennington made the playoffs four times in his career and finished 2-4, 44-37 in the regular season.
        </p>

        <p>
            Giovanni Carmazzi was the next QB taken in the draft by the San Francsico 49ers. Carmazzi never played in an
            NFL regular season game.
            He played in one game in the preseason and struggled mightily, only completing 3 of 7 passes for 19 yards in
            a 20-0 loss. Carmazzi was
            out of the league the following year. This one hurt Brady the most as he was a huge 49ers fan, growing up in
            the bay area. Tom Brady looked
            up to Joe Montana who was the 49ers QB when Brady was growing up.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next QB taken was Chris Redman in the 3rd round, by the Ravens. Redman spent eight years in the NFL but
            never
            started more than six games in a season. His career record was 4-8. He played on five teams, all as a back
            up. Redman
            spent three years on the Ravens, one year on the Patriots, one year on the Titans, was out of the league in
            2006, and joined
            the Falcons in 2007 to 2011.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tee Martin was selected by the Pittsburg Steelers with the 163rd overall selection. Martin played just three
            games in the NFL,
            none of which he started and was out of the leauge. He later went on to coaching for college teams.
        </p>

        <p>
            Marc Bulger in my opinion had a good career, atleast compared to the other QB's selected before Tom Brady.
            Bulger was selected
            to the New Orleans Saints. Marc played in 10 NFL seasons. He spent training camp with the Saints but was waived
            prior to the season.
            Bulger was picked up by the Falcons but only spent two weeks on their practice squad. He was then picked up
            by the Rams and spent
            the remainder of the season on thier practice squad. In 2001 he was signed to the active roster but was inactive as
            the teams third string
            QB. In 2003 he became the starter and took the Rams to the NFC Championship game but lost. Bulger made the
            Pro Bowl that year and won
            game MVP. Bulger made the Pro Bowl two times in his career and finished his career with a 41-54 regular
            season record and 1-2 playoff
            record.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lastly, Spergon Wynn was the last QB taken ahead of Tom Brady in that Draft. Wynn only played two NFL
            seasons and started just three games.
            He threw one touchdown and seven interceptions. These were the QB's to get drafted ahead of the G.O.A.T Thomas
            Edward Patrick Brady.

        <p>
            In the NFL, Tom Brady hasn't always recieved the love he deserved. He  was a lightly regarded prospect and he would 
            often be overlooked by analysts because others might have had better stats, ignoring the fact that Brady always, throughout his career,
            played with lesser talent than the QB's he was being compared too. Tom made the Patriots his rookie year as the fourth string QB, eventually
            becoming the backup. In 2000 the Patriots finished 5-11. In 2001, they lost the first game of the season 23-17. In game two, Drew Bledsoe got 
            hurt versus the New York Jets, late in the fourth quarter. In comes Brady for the final drive of the game, which will remain in Patriots fans memories
            as the moment that would forever change thier lives. Brady completed five of ten passes for 46 yards but New England lost the game 10-3. Down
            0-2 for the season and with their big money QB hurt, Brady was named the starter for the third game of the season vs the Indianapolis Colts. Brady remained 
            the starter that season, finishing 11-3 as the starter. (Patriots 11-5) What looked like was going to be another poor season for the Patriots, became a magical 
            one. Tom Brady played well, even winning AFC player of the week a few times and a few 4th quarter comebacks. Tom Brady was now the starting QB for the Patriots 
            regardless of Bledsoe's health status. New England won the division and had the 2nd best record in the AFC, earning them a first round bye.
        </p>

        <p>
            Tom Brady was magical in the post season. He led the Patriots back from a 10 deficit to send the game to overtime, where they won on and Adam Vinatieri field goal
            in a blizzard. The Patriots made it to the Super Bowl and were deemed 14 point underdogs. Despite this the Patriots played well, initially winning by a score of 17-3
            but the Rams cameback to tie the game in the 4th quarter, with 1:30 left on the clock. Out comes Brady in another iconic moment that will forever live in our hearts. This 
            6th round draft pick, who everyone doubted throughtout his career. The Patriots had to start on their 17th yard line, with no timeouts in the biggest game of the year. Legend 
            and Super Bowl winning coach, John Madden said he thought that the Patriots should "run out the clock and try to win the game in overtime". Instead, Brady drove the Patriots 
            down the field, making key throws all over the field. The Patriots arrived at the Rams 31 yard line, where Brady spiked the ball to stop the clock, with only seven seconds left 
            on the clock. kicker and hero Adam Vinatieri was called upon again to kick the high pressure, game winning field goal, as time expired. (which he did) The Patriots were champions.
            The underdogs won the Super Bowl and Tom Brady won game MVP. Brady was the youngest QB to ever win a Super Bowl and he did it in his first ever year starting.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The next year wasn't that great. The Patriots finished tied for the best record in the divison (9-7) but missed the playoffs due to tie breakers. In the 2003 season, the Patriots 
            started off with a 2-2 recorded but would win twelve straight games. The Patriots defeated the Titans and rival Colts to reach a second Super Bowl in Brady's third year as a starter.
            The Patriots faced off vs the South Carolina Panthers. Again Tom Brady led the Patriots on a 4th quarter game winning drive and becoming the Super Bowl MVP. Two Super Bowls in three years.
            Brady threw for 354 yards with three touchdowns and set a Super Bowl record for most completions in a game with 32. With the score tied and only one minute left in the game, Brady again
            showed why he was the best. He completed five passes, setting up hero Adam Vinatieri for a game winning field goal to end it.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next year the Patriots were on fire. Counting the wins from the last loss of the 2003 season, the Patriots went 21 straight games without a loss. (An NFL record) Again the Patriots
            finished 14-2, best record by a defending Super Bowl champion team. Patriots won the division again and entered the playoffs hot. The Patriots road to the Super Bowl wasn't an easy one. 
            They had to play against Brady's rival Peyton Manning (Colts) and an up and coming star Ben Roethlisberger lead Steelers team who were 15-1 that season. Brady beat the Steeler with his 
            best game of the season, while dealing with a cold and up against the top ranked defense in the league that year. Brady threw for 207 yards with 2 touchdown passes, 14-21 completions with 
            a passer rating of 130.5, leading them to their 3rd Super Bowl in four years. The Patriots played the Eagles in the Super Bowl and beat them 24-21. The Patriots and Cowboys are the only teams
            to win 3 out of 4 Superbowls.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 2005 season was riddled with injuries and the Patriots finished with a record of 10-6 and winning the division for a third straight time. Brady won the first playoff game in the Wild card 
            vs the Jacksonville Jaguars but lost to the Denver Broncos in the Divisonal round, Brady's first ever playoff loss of his career. Brady was 10-0 up until that game and was he was playing through 
            a sports hernia. In the 2006 season, the Patriots finished with a 12-4 record. The Patriots played the New York Jets, beating the 37-16 in the Wild Card and beating the San Diego Chargers in the 
            Divisonal Round. The Chargers were picked as favorites at home. The Patriots were down in the fourth quarter by eight points. Brady lead a drive to tie the game and later lead another drive, with a 
            49 yard bomb to wide reciever Reche Caldwell. Stephen Gostkowski kicked the field goal to put the Patriots ahead, ultimately winning the game. The Patriots played the Colts in the AFC Championship
            game in Indianapolis. The Colts won this game 38-34, marking Peytons first post season win vs Tom Brady. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2007, Tom Brady was finally playing with a big name WR in Randy Moss. Moss was a bit older by this point and the Patriots were the WR's third team but Randy was still a big time player, ready to
            team up with Brady and revive his career. Many thought that Randy Moss was done or just too much of a headache and diva. In there first year together, Randy Moss posted his best numbers. He broke the 
            touchdown record in a single season (23). Brady also had his best season to date. Brady threw for 50 touchdowns and only 8 interceptions. The previous record was 49 by rival Peyton Manning. Tom Brady 
            showed what he could do when paired with a star reciever. Brady led the Patriots to the first 16-0 record and the team scored an average of 37 points per game. The Patriots set a team record for points 
            scored in a single season with 589, beating the previous record by 33 points. The Patriots won 12 games in which they surpassed the 30-point mark, four games in which they surpassed the 40-point mark
            and two in which they surpassed the 50-point mark. The Patriots also broke season records for touchdowns scored (75), and point differential (+315). Brady was breaking all kinds of records in 2007.
            Brady broke the record for most wins ever by a starting QB in his first 100 games, broke a franchise record for touchdowns in a single game (6), and he broke the record for most consecutive games with 
            three touchdowns (9). Brady was voted unanimous league MVP, offensive player of the year, and he was honored by the Associated Press as thier Male Athlete of the year (first NFL player since Joe Montana).
            Against the Jaguars, Brady began the game completing 16-16 passes(NFL post season record) and finished the game 26-28. 93% completion percentage(single game percentage record). The Patriots tied the '72 
            Dolphins as the only team to win 17 straight game in a season. The Patriots would go on to win their 18th straight vs the Chargers, on route to the Super Bowl. Brady's fourth Super Bowl in seven years.
            Beating the Chargers marked Brady's 100th career win (100-26), also setting a NFL record for fewest games needed. Previously held by his hero Joe Montana. Brady beat his hero's record by 16 games.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 2007 Super Bowl still haunts my dreams till this day. The Giants pressured Brady throughout the whole game, sacking Brady five times and in his face for what seemed like the entire game. The game was 
            a low scoring one. Brady lead a game winning drive in the 4th quarter, leaving only 2:42 left on the clock, to take the lead 14-10. The Giants march down the field and later scored on a corner route to Burress,
            throwing the ball over Ellis Hobbs head, who bit on a slant route. Before this play, the Patriots defense had Eli Manning for a sack but he managed to break free and threw a ball to David Tyree, who caught the 
            ball against his helment. Another play that could of ended the game was a ball Eli threw directly at Patriots corner, Astante Sammuel who had the ball hit him in the hands and he dropped it. The Giants would
            later score and leave only 35 seconds on the clock. The Patriots started the drive on their 26 yard line but it was too late and they lost 17-14.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 2008 season Tom Brady injured his knee, tearing his ACL and MCL in the first game of the season vs the Cheifs, ending his season. Many point to this season as proof that Bill Belichick is the reason for the Patriots success 
            because the Patriots would go on to win 11 games with five losses. My view on this is that, the Patriots still had Randy Moss and went 16-0 with Tom Brady at the helm. The 2007 Patriots broke multiple records and went to the
            Super Bowl. The 2008 Patriots missed the playoffs losing key tie breaker games. Matt Cassel threw for 3,693 yards with 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions, compared to Brady's 4,806 yards with 50 touchdowns and 8 interceptions.
            With Tom Brady; Randy Moss caught 98 passes for 1,493 yards with 23 touchdowns, compared to with Cassel he caught 69 passes for 1,008 yards with 11 touchdowns. The '08 team had the same offense the '07 team did and with Brady 
            it would of continued. Matt Cassel is a good QB and had success after leaving the Patriots. Cassel brought the Chiefs to the playoffs and had a good career.
